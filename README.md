Kaggle Titantic
===

Code and writing for submissions made to the [Kaggle Titantic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) competition, as a part of a course project for STAT5302: Applied Regression Analysis.

Tasks:
 - Clean the "ticket" column to create a factor for the ticket type and a continuous (?) column for the number
 - Do some kind of feature selection process to include only relevant variables (e.g. via AIC)
 - Do some kind of search for second-order and higher-order interaction effects between variables
 - Search for non-linear relationships between the variables and the response (e.g. polynomial terms, log/power transforms)
 - Consider some kind of feature derived from passenger names
 - Handle missing data in continuous columns
 - Handle missing data in factor columns
 - Do something with the Cabin information
 - Create cross-validation split for use by team (?)
 - Try other model approaches:
	Decision tree
	xgboost (Gradient boosted decision tree)
	Python sklearn for ensemble model
	Look up how to do ensemble models in R?
	Neural approach?
 - Write report
